# Terraform Reference Engine Sample Provisioning Artifacts

This directory contains sample provisioning artifacts that can be used to test a deployment of the Terraform Reference Engine.

## Simple S3 Bucket

File: s3bucket.tar.gz

### Provisioning Parameters

* bucket_name

### Resources

* A simple S3 bucket with default settings

### Launch Role Permissions

The following permissions are required in the product's launch role in order to provision, update, terminate and tag.

* S3 permissions to manage a bucket's lifecycle
* S3 permissions to tag a bucket. This allows the engine to set its tracer tag on the resource. The tracer tag is used by Service Catalog to identify the resources belonging to the provisioned product.
* Resource group and tagging permissions: This is required for every launch role on a terraform open source product. Service Catalog requires these permissions to apply system and user tags to the resources.

Example:

```
            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action: 
                  - s3:CreateBucket*
                  - s3:DeleteBucket*
